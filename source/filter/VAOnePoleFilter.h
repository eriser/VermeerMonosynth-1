/* 
   A very basic Virtual Analogue One Pole Filter based on calculations from The Art of VA Filter Design
   by Vadim Zavalishin see:

   NOTE : Need to implement oversampling as frequency response is incorrect at high frequencies approaching nyquist
   there is lost energy/gain which will be apparent on the filters response display (common issue with VA filters). You
   will notice the frequency response suddenly drops off as the cutoff approaches nyquist.
   This will be addressed in the next version.
